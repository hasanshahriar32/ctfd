# The pain of losing a loved one.

Aapa used to tell us many things; sometimes she even cried. But we never told her "xkdyu\_uyw\_uyby\_zbsiy". I'm typing it now, but something strange is happening! If your keyboard is working properly, fix the flag and submit it.

It is a very common Caesar cipher, which can be decoded using any alphabet shifting tool. For my case, I used [https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher)



After inputting the payload, I kept shifting the alphabets until something meaningful came in. At 16th place shifting, I got that special saying.
