**Solution:**

The username is hinted at in the question. username: shorif\_0x3c

So, for a known username, it is mostly suggested to do a dictionary password attack. As it is more likely to succeed at this method. So I used Burp Suite's intruder method at first. But it was in vain.

Next, I did common password attack.. which has some common passwords, like

> admin\
> password\
> 12345\
> qwerty

But it was also in vain. \

After that I tried to use a blank password. But the HTML form required writing something in the password field. For that I did a workaround by omitting the "required" attribute from the form's password field.&#x20;

Then I tried to submit the login form. And it was successful! ðŸ¥³
